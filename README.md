# Time-Series-on-HAR

The project is based on my work on Human Activity Recognition using Time Series Analysis. The data-set used was "ARAS human activity 
datasets in multiple homes with multiple residents", by Hande Alemdar ; Halil Ertan ; Ozlem Durmaz Incel ; Cem Ersoy. The daata-set
is a sparse data, consisting of entries of 20 sensors, and the corresponding activities(27) performed by the two residents of the house.
The data-set was collected on two different houses for a month.

My work involved to apply the time series on the given data and generate the predictive model out of it.
